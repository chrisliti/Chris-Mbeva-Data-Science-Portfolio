# Chris Mbeva Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
I am a dynamic and adaptable Data Scientist with a robust background spanning banking and finance, agriculture technology, and consulting. Proficient in the entire data science spectrum, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights. My expertise encompasses extracting actionable tasks from business requirements, developing comprehensive data pipelines, performing exploratory analysis, building statistical models, and deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions. Skilled in programming languages such as Python and R, frameworks for APIs and web development, and adept in cloud computing, I bring a versatile skill set to every project.

## Projects / Use Cases

### Data Extraction
- **Web Scraping:** Leveraged Python libraries like BeautifulSoup to scrape financial data from various websites. Automated on AWS virtual machines (ec2 instances), resulting insights significantly enhanced product design.
- **Partner APIs:** Developed automated pipelines to extract and process data from partner institutions, incorporating textual data from third-party APIs like Twitter for sentiment analysis. Augmenting external data improved the quality of internal models.
- **Databases:** Created data pipelines to query and process customer and transaction data from SQL databases, contributing to credit scoring and machine learning use cases.

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- **Dashboarding:** Gathered business requirements and designed interactive dashboards with metrics, tables, and graphs, facilitating data-driven decision-making and promoting data awareness within the organization.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted AB tests to understand customer preferences and uptake of financial products, leading to product customization and enhanced user experience.
- **RFM Credit Segmentation:** Developed models for customer risk segmentation and credit limit allocation, clustering customers into risk categories with minimal development effort.

### Machine Learning & AI
- **Credit Scoring:** Built credit scorecards using logistic regression modeling, significantly reducing consultancy costs.
- **Customer Clustering:** Employed KMeans clustering to identify customer segments for targeted marketing, resulting in a 20% improvement in mortgage conversion rates.
- **Product Recommendation:** Developed recommendation engines using collaborative filtering and association rules, driving SME product uptake by 30%.
- **Fraud Detection:** Created a fraud detection algorithm using XGBoost, saving the fraud team over 60% of time by focusing on high-risk transactions.
- **Forecasting:** Developed revenue forecasting models using Metaâ€™s Prophet framework, guiding organizational revenue targets and strategic initiatives.
- **Generative AI:** Leveraged large language models to develop sentiment analysis pipelines and chatbots, enhancing product knowledge among colleagues.
- **Computer Vision:** Designed applications for plant disease detection and livestock scanning, improving farming practices and providing valuable information to farmers.
